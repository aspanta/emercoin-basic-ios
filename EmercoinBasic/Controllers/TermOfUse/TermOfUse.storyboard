These Terms apply to the Emercoin client software and the Emercoin distributed open source global payment network accessed through that software and services (collectively, “Emercoin Blockchain”, “Emercoin Blockchain Services”). As further described in Section 4 (Assumption of Risk with Emercoin), Emercoin does not own or control the Emercoin Blockchain or Emercoin Blockchain Services and you are solely responsible for your use of the Emercoin Blockchain and Emercoin Blockchain Services.

We will provide notice of these changes by posting the revised Terms to the Site and changing the “Last Revised” date at the top of the Terms, or by providing other means of notice as Emercoin will determine each time in its sole discretion. Using a particular form of notice in some instances does not obligate us to use the same form in other instances. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to the Emercoin Website at http://www.emercoin.com and/or affiliated web resources (collectively, “Site”), and will apply to your subsequent use of the Site. You waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued use of this Site will confirm your acceptance of such changes or modifications; therefore, you should review the Terms and applicable policies whenever you use the Site to understand the terms that apply to such use.

12. ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH EMERCOIN AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.

ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. In any arbitration, the parties will not seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in an private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if Emercoin is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have been dropped from the Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.
 
13. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION
Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Emercoin reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your right to use the Site, and to block or prevent your future access to, and use of, the Site.

15. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Terms is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
